# flacnn

_Pronounced as "[flaxen](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Dictionary#dobs=flaxen)"_

This is a (currently non-existant) toy experiment to use a [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN) to find flares. At the momemnt 
it's more a fun example for [me](https://github.com/mattpitkin/) to use to try and learn how to code up a CNN.

It will start (at some undefined point in the future) by testing on entirely fake data, but may in the future evolve to run
on the real stuff!
